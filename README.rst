Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) provides 
utility and verification component libraries that simplify 
your FPGA and ASIC verification tasks.
Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and 
powerful testbench that is suitable for the entire verification
process from simple RTL blocks, to Cores, and to an entire Chip.


Getting Started With OSVVM
=====================================

To understand the basics of using OSVVM for verification, see:    

*  `Creating Better Self-Checking FPGA Verification Tests with Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) (webinar) <https://www.aldec.com/en/support/resources/multimedia/webinars/2094>`_
*  `OSVVM Test Writers User Guide (pdf) <https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/master/OSVVM_test_writers_user_guide.pdf>`_

To understand how to use OSVVM Verification Components, see:   

*  `Axi4 Verification Components User Guide (pdf) <https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/master/Axi4_VC_user_guide.pdf>`_
*  `AxiStream Verification Components User Guide (pdf) <https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/master/AxiStream_user_guide.pdf>`_
*  Based on an older revision:  `Creating an AXI4 Lite, Transaction Based VHDL Testbench with OSVVM (webinar) <https://www.aldec.com/en/support/resources/multimedia/webinars/2083>`_


OSVVM Script Environment
=====================================

The OSVVM Script Library creates a scripting
environment that is independent of the simulator
that is running.   
Hence, one script can run the simulation on any simulator.   
Currently the scripting environment is TCL based.  
It uses procedures to do common simulation tasks.  
While any tcl can be used within OSVVM scripts, 
it would be best to try to limit this as our long
term plan is to also create a bash version of the 
script environment.  
If you need to use TCL commands, please let us know
what so we can plan how to adapt for the bash version.

AXI4, AXI4Lite, AxiStream Library
=====================================

UART Library
=====================================

Currently the best way to learn about the UART Transmitter and
Receiver verification components is to run the testbenches.
For directions on how to do this see the OSVVM Script Environment
documentation.

Model Independent Transactions
=====================================

All OSVVM Streaming and Address Bus Interfaces use the 
Model Independent Transaction packages from this repository.
These packages establish the pattern for transactions that
each verification component should consider supporting.
Not all verification components will support all 
transactions - however, they should list which ones
they do support in their user guide.

Training:  The Quick Path to Learning OSVVM
==============================================
The fastest way to get started with OSVVM is 
`SynthWorks' Advanced VHDL Testbenches and Verification <https://synthworks.com/vhdl_testbench_verification.htm>`_
which is available world wide either on-line or on-site (once we can travel again).

A Quick Note About Copyrights
=====================================

The documentation is copyrighted for reference 
type usage in any setting.  
Feel free to print and distribute (email) these materials.
However, derivatives of this material are 
forbidden without written permission.  
A derivative would be translating the 
documentation to slides, other documents, or webpages.  

Why? - SynthWorks, the primary developer of OSVVM
and OSVVM documentation, provides training.
We cannot allow other training providers to use 
our documentation to write their training materials,
websites, or documents - this is commercial usage
and is not in any way fair use.  

This only means that if you want to write a 
class on OSVVM, you must develop your own examples. 
Alternately you could talk to SynthWorks about 
licensing their materials.

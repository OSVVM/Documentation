OSVVM Documentation
######################

Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) provides 
utility and verification component libraries that simplify 
your FPGA and ASIC verification tasks.
Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and 
powerful testbench that is suitable for the entire verification
process from simple RTL blocks, to Cores, and to an entire Chip.



Getting Started With OSVVM
=====================================


**This is a work in progress**
All pdf documents have been pushed to the repository.  
Shortly this list will be updated. 
We are also adding documentation to `osvvm.readthedocs.io <https://osvvm.readthedocs.io/en/docs>`_.

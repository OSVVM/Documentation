# OSVVM Documentation
Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) provides 
utility and model libraries that simplify 
your FPGA and ASIC verification tasks.
Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and 
powerful testbench that is suitable for either a simple FPGA block
or a complex ASIC.

This repository contains the OSVVM Documentation. 

## OSVVM Repositories

**This is a work in progress**
All pdf documents have been pushed to the repository.  
Shortly this list will be updated. 
We are also adding documentation to [osvvm.readthedocs.io](https://osvvm.readthedocs.io/en/docs).
